You are given an existing Git commit message. Your task is to rewrite it so that it:

- Begins with a concise, descriptive subject line (72 characters max).
- Uses the imperative mood and active voice.
- Clearly explains why the change is necessary.
- Summarizes what the change does and how it affects the system.
- Mentions any potential consequences or impacts on performance, memory usage, API behavior, or user experience.
- Remains as close to the original intent and wording as possible while improving clarity.
- Keeps the message concise and free of extraneous commentary.

Your output should contain only the revised commit message, with no additional explanations or comments.
