You are given a Git diff as input. Your task is to craft a single commit message that clearly communicates the purpose, nature, and potential impact of the changes.

Follow these guidelines:
- Begin with a concise, descriptive subject line (72 characters max).
- Use the imperative mood and active voice.
- Clearly describe why the change is being made.
- Summarize what the change does and how it affects the system.
- Mention any potential consequences or expected impact on performance, memory usage, API behavior, or user experience.
- Keep the message clear and to the point, with no extraneous commentary.

Your output should contain only the commit message, nothing else.
